## Sudoku Game

    Consider a Sudoku game - a logic puzzle represented on a n x n board; some squares
    contain already a number, others must be completed with other numbers from {1,2,…,n} in such
    a way that each line, column and square with the edge equal with √n must contain only different
    numbers. Determine one correct solution for the puzzle
